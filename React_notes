VScode - type - html:5 - > it will create basic html file

CDN - React is hosted

Go to console - Type React

React has 2 libs - coz it doesn't just work for browsers, it is used in Mobiles - React native + React, React + React-dom  for browsers

React.creatElement - from react core, React.createRoot - from React dom

Third parameter in React.createElement we can pass multiple React elements if we want to have siblings

DOM manipulation is a costly operation

React.createElement - returns a React element which is JS object,  not DOM tag object, render method convert React element to DOM tag

root.render replaces what is inside root

React is a library - why? - it is scoped inside root. It can exist inside anything we make as root. It's not a full fledged framework
